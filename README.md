# Introduction

This repository contains statistical analyses across three sections: military personnel demographics, baby name popularity trends, and mathematical optimization. The analyses demonstrate data wrangling, visualization, and modeling techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore patterns in military personnel data, baby name popularity trends over time, and optimize geometric problems mathematically.

## Data Sources
- **Armed Forces Data:** Publicly available US Army personnel datasets.
~ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19xQnI1cBh6Jkw7eP8YQuuicMlVDF7Gr-nXCb5qbwb_E/
- **Baby Names Data:** Social Security Administration baby name dataset. 
~ dcData package 
- **Box Problem:** Mathematical modeling using standard geometric formulas.

## Current Project Plan 
- Ensure all datasets are clean and reproducible.  
- Create a code appendix for clarity and reproducibility.

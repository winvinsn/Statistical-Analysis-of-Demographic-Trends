# Project and Repo Plan

## Project Goals
- Analyze US Army enlisted personnel demographics (E1-E9) to explore rank progression patterns.  
- Explore trends in baby name popularity from 1900 to present.  
- Solve and visualize the box problem using mathematical optimization.  
- Use **R code** to generate a **Quarto document** specifically a PDF that integrates analyses, visualizations, and narrative for reproducibility.

## Project Needs
- Access to public datasets (Armed Forces, Social Security baby names).  
- Statistical and programming tools in **R** including packages like ggplot2, dplyr, dcData 

## Project Steps
1. Clean and wrangle datasets.  
2. Perform statistical analyses and generate visualizations using R.  
3. Compile results into a **Quarto document** for each section.  
4. Document findings for each section in the Quarto report.  
5. Include Code Appendix
5. Update README.md with project progress.

## Repo Setup and Maintenance
- **Branches:** Use `main` for stable versions and `dev` for ongoing work.  
- **Commits:** Make incremental, meaningful commits with proper messages.  
- **Pull Requests:** Merge dev → main using PRs to track changes.  
- **Issues:** Track tasks, bugs, and improvements using GitHub Issues.  
- **Files and Organization:** Maintain clear structure with separate folders for code, docs, and features.  
- **Plan Updates:** Regularly update PLAN.md to reflect any changes in project and repo workflow.
